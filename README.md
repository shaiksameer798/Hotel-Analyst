## Project Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate and understand key metrics in hotel occupancy data, such as average occupancy rates, city-wise performance, and revenue generation. The analysis will cover various time frames (e.g., month of June, weekdays vs. weekends) and factors such as room categories and booking platforms.

Datasets
The analysis is based on the following five datasets:

dim_date.csv: Contains date-related information.
dim_hotels.csv: Details of hotels, including location and category.
dim_rooms.csv: Contains data on room categories and types.
fact_aggregated_bookings.csv: Aggregated booking data by hotel.
fact_bookings.csv: Detailed booking records.
## Datasets
The analysis is based on the following five datasets:

- dim_date.csv: Contains date-related information.
- dim_hotels.csv: Details of hotels, including location and category.
- dim_rooms.csv: Contains data on room categories and types.
- fact_aggregated_bookings.csv: Aggregated booking data by hotel.
- fact_bookings.csv: Detailed booking records.

Dataset Preparation: Place the datasets in the project root directory or in a data folder.

## Analysis Steps
 ### Data Import and Exploration
 - Load data from CSV files using pandas and inspect the data structure.
- Perform basic exploration to understand the columns, data types, and initial trends.
### Data Cleaning and Transformation
- Handle missing values, incorrect data types, and duplicates.
- Merge datasets to form a unified view for analysis.
### Insights Generation
With the cleaned data, generate the following insights:
  #### Average Occupancy Rate by Room Category:

- Calculate the average occupancy rate for each room category.
  #### Average Occupancy Rate per City:

- Aggregate occupancy data on a per-city basis.
#### Occupancy on Weekdays vs. Weekends:

- Determine if occupancy is higher on weekdays or weekends.
#### City-Wise Occupancy for June:

- Analyze occupancy rates for different cities during June.
#### Append August Data:

- Add newly available August data to the existing data.
#### Revenue Realized per City:

- Calculate revenue generated by each city based on booking details.
#### Month-by-Month Revenue:

- Display the revenue generated month by month.
#### Revenue by Booking Platform (Pie Chart):

 - Visualize revenue breakdown by booking platform using a pie chart.
## Key Insights
- Average occupancy rates across different room categories.
- Comparative analysis of city-wise performance.
- Occupancy trends between weekdays and weekends.
- Detailed monthly occupancy and revenue trends.
Results
Key results will be available as:

A table displaying occupancy rates by room category and city.
Revenue trend plots (monthly and per platform).
A pie chart showing the revenue contribution of each booking platform.
